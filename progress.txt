Progress so far:
-create GUI for shipping information input.

TODO:
-create a main menu for the GUI to give option of entering new information and retrieving current/old shipping information.
-write code for text processing (take raw inputs and organize information for use on the manufacture side).
-create executable jar file to run shipping management program.

Overall purpose:
-shipping management system that organizes customer order/shipping information and generate a shipping invoice for shipments.
-management system should also allow manufacture to look back and pull up desired order/shipping information.
